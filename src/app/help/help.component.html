                    <p>The objective of Safari Canasta is to be the first player of a team to play all the cards from your hand into melds, complete two canastas and to go out before the other team does. Canastas consist of seven cards which are either mixed with two wild cards or are natural with no wild card substitutions. All other melds on the board have at least three cards. </p>
                    <p>This version of Canasta has a modern twist and is a little more challenging of a version as opposed to the traditional Canasta played worldwide. </p>
                    <p>It's not hard, rather the 3's 7's and Aces are played completely different than what you might be used to. This version also includes a natural wild card canasta and bonus hands that end the round and give lots of points! This version is exhilarating and has more levels of risk and reward and is well worth learning to play.</p>
                    <p>In Safari Canasta, you can play with friends by a specific game code invitation or randomly with other players by creating or joining a new game in either four rooms based on your preference of pace and or skill level.</p>

                            <p>To begin playing, 108 cards are shuffled at least 5 times and dealt.</p>

                            <h3>Wild Card</h3>
                            <p>Jokers and 2's are wild. You can use two cards and a wild only when you are making initial melds (Q-Q-Joker). After that, wilds cannot be added to melds of cards until there are five of the natural card in the meld. (e.g. Q-Q-Q-Q-Q-Joker-2) </p>
                            <p>You can use up to two wilds to complete a canasta or use all wilds to make a natural wild card canasta. In making this type of canasta, it is suggested that you start it early in the game and with a minimum of four wilds, hoping that you and your partner will obtain three more wilds before the other team goes out or the game ends. You will be penalized points if you do not complete the wild card canasta. To open, you technically can use a minimum of three wilds and other melds on board to obtain your required initial meld points.</p>
                            <p>Wild card canastas can be risky at times and can hold up using wilds for other melds, plus you can't go out until a wild card canasta gets completed. </p>
                            <p>It is not permitted to add wilds to a 7's canasta or discard wild cards unless you are down to only wild cards in your hand, with the exception of discarding as your final card upon going out.</p>

                            <h3>3's, 7's and Aces</h3>
                            <p>3's, 7's and Aces may not be discarded on an empty discard pile unless it is the only option in your hand to lay down one of the three choices.</p>

                            <h3>3's</h3>
                            <p>The 3's are bonus cards and cannot be used for melds. For each hand, they add total point value only after two canastas are made. There are penalty points if no canastas are made. When they are put on the board, you will automatically be dealt replacement card(s) during your turn. </p>

                            <h3>Melding</h3>                            
                            <p>- To create an initial meld you will need a minimum of two cards of the same value with a wild card or a minimum of three cards of the same value to lay down on the board.</p>
                            <p>- To create additional melds or canastas after opening on the board, you will now need a minimum of three cards of the same value to get on the board or five cards of the same value plus 1-2 wild cards to complete a canasta. </p>
                            <p> - After melding, laying single cards down is acceptable and is how melds are built into canastas. Make sure wilds are only added to a meld containing five natural cards first.</p>
                            <p> - An initial meld must include a "natural triple" (e.g. Q,Q,Q) on the board in addition to any melds for required card count minimums. This can be tricky because you wouldn't want to use Aces or 7's as a natural triple, because Aces and 7's have to be natural and not mixed with wilds in order to complete or a penalty will arise. You would not know that early in the game if you could secure 7's or Aces for canastas, so steer clear of using those towards your natural triple.</p>
                            <p> - You can pick up the deck as part of your initial meld but are not permitted to use that top card as part of your natural triple, nor count that top card as points toward your initial melding.</p>
                            <p> - If you have a natural canasta in your hand, regardless of point value, you can open on the board. This would be rare and cool!</p>
                            <p> - Mis-melding by not being able to open will cause a 10 point penalty added to the minimum to open for your team's next turn and only in that round. Penalties during a round can accumulate so be careful to count carefully before adding to board! The next round will reset to whatever the required open meld is based on how many points your team has accrued.</p>

                            <p>- If the pack is picked with Aces or 7's, the canasta must be melded and completed naturally.</p>

                    <p>Signaling is the first round of play allows partners to calculate if they have a minimum of five wild cards in hands and to decide whether or not to go for a wild card canasta.</p>
                    <p>To signal that you have three or more wild cards, discard a 10-point card. if your partner has two or more wild cards, they should respond with a 10-point card. if they have less than two wild cards, they should respond with a 5-point card.</p>
                    <h3>Aces & 7's</h3>
                    <p>A Player having more than two aces or more than two 7's should discard one as a signal to their partner. The Partner will then discard all aces or 7's to give a count and to decide about trying for a pure aces or 7's canasta.</p>
